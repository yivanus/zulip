# Announcement-only streams

{!admin-only.md!}

By default, anyone who belongs to a stream can also send messages to the
stream. However, sometimes it's useful to have a stream (often a
[default stream](/help/set-default-streams-for-new-users)) where only
organization administrators can send messages.
