# Delete a topic

{!admin-only.md!}

We generally recommend against deleting topics, but there are a few
situations in which it can be useful:

* Clearing out test messages after setting up an organization.

* Clearing out messages from an overly enthusiastic bot.

* Managing abuse.

In most other cases, [renaming a topic](/help/rename-a-topic) is often a
better idea, or just leaving the topic as is. Deleting a topic can confuse
users who come to the topic later via an email notification.
