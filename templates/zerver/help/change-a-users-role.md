# Change a user's role

{!admin-only.md!}

Users join as
[administrators, members, or guests](/help/roles-and-permissions), depending
on how they were invited.

An organization administrator can change the role of any other user.
An admin can revoke their own administrative privileges if there is at least one
other administrator in the organization.
